# modavr
This is a version of classic Sony PS1 "Old Crow" modchip implemented on Atmel ATtiny13 AVR microcontroller.

The goal of the project was:

- to implement a modchip with low-cost, easy to obtain and easy to program Atmel AVR microcontroller
- to find out how PS1 modchip works and write an easy to understand self-explanatory code

This chip does not act like later mod chips that were designed to defeat the more intelligent copy-protection schemes seen on the later Final Fantasy discs and later system releases. This constantly injects a region code into the system. I believe Final Fantasy 8 is one of the games this chip will not work on

Perhaps with some tinkering the chip could shut it's self off after a certian period. Testing and commits are welcome.

With the release of devices like the PSIO, this chip is mostly obsolete exept for those who like to play import games, run physical copies of hard to find homebew, or their old pirated CDRs.
